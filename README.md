# Use LLM (ChatGPT 3.5) for Text Understanding

## Scope of this project

How we can do advanced text analysis in texts with political content? Researchers have found that LLMs are capable of carrying out nearly any text analysis task we throw at them. As these models are general rather than taskspecific, they are even able to carry out tasks that traditional computational methods have failed at – such as irony, sarcasm or subjective and contextual interpretation. Recent studies have found that LLMs perform well for a wide range of purposes, including ideological scaling, text annotation tasks, for simulating samples for survey research, and much more.
As an illustrating example, we will draw on the important task of measuring polarization in political texts. Political polarization represents the intensity of binary, opposing political ideologies and their respective party identities.
The project is designed as an experimental collaboration between political theory and data science. I’ve started this project with a focus on the Greek general elections, that took place before 4 months and more specifically in the political speeches of the two major leaders, K.Mitsotakis(New Democracy) and A.Tsipras(SYRIZA).
